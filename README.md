Cesar Colunga's Phase 1 Project
As the name implies this is my Phase 1 Project.

From my understanding these are the project requirements as far as coding is concerned:

1. Create a Single Page Application (SPA) using HTML, CSS and Javascript 
2. Access data from a public API (or a db.json) file => I decided to use a public API
3. Implement at least 5 objects with each object having at least 3 attributes.
4. All client-API interactions should be asynchronous and use JSON for communication.
5. Utilize event listeners for interactivity (at least 3 distinct event types)
6. Implement array iteration using available array methods (map, forEach, filter, etc.)
7. Keep code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) by using functions.
8. Complete a README.md file.

Other requirements are:
1. Schedule a project review with instructor
2. Record a video walkthrough of App
3. Write a blog post (which can be 1 of the 5 requires ones)

[unrelated] Koby Bryant would compartamentalize big problems; since this project has a lot for imagination; I would like to compartamentalize the steps I would take to complete this project.

TODOS:
1. Project Idea and design:
    - Decide on a project idea and core features.
    - Develop user stories to clarify the application's functionality.
    - Plan out the structure of the JSON requests.
2. Repository Setup:
    - Create a new GitHub repository for your project.
    - Clone the repository to local machine
    - Make the repository public
3. Dependencies and Structure:
    - Set up the basic files (Js, Css, HTML) and directory structure for your frontend.
    - Choose whether to use a public API or a json-server.
4. Create a README.md:
    - Create README file
    - Describe project, installation steps, features, etc.
5. Commit History:
    - Aim for a detailed commit history (goal is 30 commits)
    - Commit frequently with meaningful messages.


For step 2: I would like to utilize the JSON public API for dogs.
